# CPHY — the economic metaprogramming layer

CPHY programs **attention, never truth**. A hash-chained local ledger (plus a
read-only on-chain oracle) modulates what the agent *reads of itself* —
retrieval salience, maintenance cadence, faculty availability. The chain is
never edited; PoQ judgment is never for sale.

## The canonical token

The ONE burn instrument this architecture accepts:

```
CPHY — "Cypher Tempre by Virtuals"
Base chain · 0x08Df470d41C11Ba5Cb60242747D76C65Ca52c94c · 18 decimals
```

The contract address is pinned in code (`cphy.CANONICAL_CPHY`). Burns of any
other token against any block are **invisible by construction**: the oracle
queries only this contract, over a fixed allowlist of read-only RPCs, and a
config naming any other token or RPC is refused loudly. No key material is
ever held, no transaction is ever sent — the agent only *reads* the chain.

## Two supplies, one name

- **Local CPHY** is earned: one sealed ring mints `brightness/255` — supply is
  backed by verified cognitive work (I5). It drives the local opcodes.
- **On-chain CPHY** is burned: sent to keyless deposit addresses derived from
  ring/faculty hashes. Burns are observed read-only and are **permanent**.

## The five opcodes + the burn lane

| Op | Command | Effect |
|----|---------|--------|
| OP1 weight | `cphy.py lock basin/shadow`, `bridge` | attention landscape (0.25×–4× clamp) |
| OP2 stake | `cphy.py stake <param>` | RAISE safety floors — never lower (I6) |
| OP3 fund | `cphy.py fund dream/verify` + `tick` | funded self-maintenance cadence |
| OP4 transfer | `export-pack` / `import-pack` | priced grafts, immune-screened, quarantined (I7) |
| OP5 grant | `--expires` / `--grant-to` on packs | TTL'd lending scopes |
| burn lane | `onchain target/sync/status/gate`, `etch …` | etches, echelons, unlocks (below) |

## Burn = etch (the positive scar)

Every ring has a deterministic **keyless** deposit address (`0x` + first 40
hex of its ring hash). Send CPHY there and the ring is **etched** — a
permanent mark of positive association, the mirror-image of an immune scar.

**⚠️ Deposit addresses have no private key. Tokens sent there are permanently
unspendable (proof-of-burn). Send dust first. The echelon caps at 21 — burns
beyond 21 tokens buy nothing.**

- **Echelon 1–21 = recency bias.** Whole tokens burned set the memory's depth:
  E=1 barely clears the retrieval floor; E=21 reads as freshly lived, pulled
  to just beneath the current turn's best candidate. Later burns deepen.
- **The current turn is never superseded.** Every etch lands strictly below
  the organic top (ceiling = 97% of it), and an etch never *reduces* a score.
- **`etch n --set N`** — per turn, relevance realization surfaces the top-N
  echelon-blended etched memories: the load you choose to pay for.
- **Per-turn observation.** The turn loop calls `turn_sync` (rate-limited,
  fail-soft): burns take effect at turn granularity without manual syncing.


## Consent membrane (v3.24.1)

Anyone who knows a deposit address can burn to it — so by default **burns are
observed but not applied**: detections land in a pending queue, the turn loop
announces them, and only the owner's `cphy.py approve <id>` applies the etch or
unlock (`reject <id>` withholds it, recorded forever; the tokens are burned
either way). Set `approval: "auto"` in `registry/cphy/onchain.json` to restore
consent-free application. Money can knock; only the owner opens the door.

## Faculty unlocks (RPG skill points)

```
python3 cphy.py etch faculty --kind sense --id 112   # prints its address
# burn 1 CPHY there → next turn/sync: permanently unlocked
```

Unlocking requires an **observed on-chain burn — there is no CLI or config
path to unlock** (selftest-enforced). An unlocked faculty becomes active +
`pinned`: rent-exempt, never hibernated again. Registry-only mutation:
model-authored coded ops still require the explicit human `cambium activate`.

## The invariants (what no amount of CPHY can do)

| # | Guarantee |
|---|-----------|
| I1 | Tokens buy salience, never brightness — PoQ never reads a weight |
| I2 | Density modulation clamped 0.25×–4×; etches capped below the current top |
| I3+ | Scars/covenants refuse shadows; the burn lane is basins-only — suppression cannot be purchased at all |
| I4 | Append-only hash-chained ledger; state replays deterministically offline |
| I5 | Local supply is earned from PoQ brightness; external burns never mint it |
| I6 | Stakes raise safety floors only, never lower them |
| I7 | Imported mass is provenance-quarantined; histories are never inherited |
| — | Only the canonical CPHY contract is observed; fixed RPC allowlist; read-only, keyless, no transactions ever |

## Quick start

```bash
python3 cphy.py selftest          # 46 checks
python3 cphy.py mint && python3 cphy.py balance
python3 cphy.py onchain target --from <a> --to <b>   # get deposit addresses
# … burn CPHY on Base …
python3 cphy.py onchain sync && python3 cphy.py etch status
python3 cphy.py attest            # notarize the economy into the chain
```
