# Cypher Tempre — Stop hook: HARD block turn-end until a ring is sealed this turn.
# enforce.py emits the Stop-hook JSON contract on stdout:
#   block -> {"decision":"block","reason":"..."}  (Claude must continue and seal)
#   allow -> (no output)                          (turn may end)
# Bounded (MAX_NUDGES) and fail-open: a model that genuinely cannot seal is freed
# after a few nudges and an adherence_violation is recorded — never bricked.

# own stdout to guarantee this). Set CT_ENFORCE_DEBUG=1 to surface enforce.py
# stderr (warnings + tracebacks) when diagnosing; 0/false/no/off stay quiet.
# The stdout JSON stays clean either way. exit 0 always: the gate is fail-open.
